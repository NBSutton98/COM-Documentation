## Use the Get Request Boilerplate 
- Navigate to the [website](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html), where the boilerplate can be found
- Copy the Get request from the website and paste it into your file

## Getting started with res.send

- Explain how res.send will send a message

- Type the following in the terminal: **node .\filename**
- In the same terminal, the program can be stopped by typing the following: *CTRL + UPPERCASE C*
