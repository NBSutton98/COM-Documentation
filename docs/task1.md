# Getting Started with Express JS

In this section, we will go over the steps to installing and creating our first file.

## Creating our file
- Select new file that you will be creating
- Name our file to whatever name of your choice, make sure to include **.js** at the end

## Getting Started with Express JS
- Navigate to the terminal window by going to **VIEW --> TERMINAL**
  - This can also be done with the shortcut: *(CTRL + SHIFT + `)*
- Once the terminal has opened, click into it
- Type the following: **npm init**


## Copy over the boilerplate code
- We will next copy over the boilerplate code provided to us by Express
- navigate to the [Express JS Setting Started](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html) website
- Add req Object to test functionality (what does this do)

## Installing express
- After we have typed **npm init**, we will be asked to enter details about our file
- Continuously press *ENTER* until all done
- Navigate to the newly created **package.json** that npm has created for us
- Verify the names inside **package.json** match what we have installed
- Type the following: *npm install express*
- To verify we did the last steps correctly, type the following into the terminal: *node .\filename*
